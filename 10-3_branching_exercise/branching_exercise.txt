1. What git command creates a branch? ==> git checkout -b NAME_OF_BRANCH

2. What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?  ==> 
A fast-forward merge is possible when there is a linear path from the current branch to the target path, 
i.e. there have been no commits on the original branch while the branch is being worked on.
A recursive merge is used when there have been commits on the new branch while the original 
branch is being worked on. 

3. What git command changes to another branch? ==> git checkout NAME_OF_BRANCH

4. What git command deletes a branch? ==> git branch -D

5. How do merge conflicts happen? ==> 
Merge conflicts occur when their are different commits with changes to the same file 
that exists in two different branches. A merge conflict occurs when git cannot determine what 
file or folder to choose when trying to merge.
